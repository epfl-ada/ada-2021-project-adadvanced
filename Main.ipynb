    "- *[Data cleaning and merging](#augmentation)* : Perform a final cleaning on the quotations as well as on the speakers and generate 3 main datasets that will be used for the analysis\n",

Quotations and speakers that carry similar attributes/ideas will belong to the same cluster. Performing such task can be performed using the following pipeline:\n",
    "1. The first step is to convert sentences into vectors. This task can be achieved using the [SentenceTransformer](https://www.sbert.net/docs/usage/semantic_textual_similarity.html) deep neural network. The vector obtained from this operation cab be then concatenated with the other existing features (that would be converted to one hot vectors if necessary) (ALREADY DONE).\n",
    "2. The second step consists in reducing the dimension of the data before applying the clustering algorithm. This task can be achieved using the [Locally Linear Embeddings](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.LocallyLinearEmbedding.html#sklearn.manifold.LocallyLinearEmbedding) algorithm. This algorithm is considered to be an efficient non-linear dimensionality reduction method.\n",
    "3. The third step is specific to speaker clustering. Indeed, the vectorization of quotes as well as the reduction of dimensionality are only applied to quotes. Thus, we need to perform an **aggregation** to be able to attribute a vector to each speaker. For each speaker, this aggregation can simply be done by taking the mean of the vectors associated with each of their quotations. \n",
    "4. The last step consists in performing the clustering operation. This task can be achieved using [Spectral Clustering](#https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering.html#sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering) method.\n",
