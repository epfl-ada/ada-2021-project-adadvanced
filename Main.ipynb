    "\n",
    "In the `aug_quotebank_brexit` we will have a lot of information coming from the speaker such as the `nationality` or the `occupation`. However one can notice that sometimes the neural network didn't succeed in finding a speaker and fill `speaker` entry with `None` value. These missing values are difficult to handle as it would require to guess who told the quotation. One could think about training a classifier on the datas where the speaker is mentionned but it is actually a fastidious task that we are not able to manage. So unfortunaltely the last solution to get ride of these datas was chosen in the `aug_quotebank_brexit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An other issue comes from the fact that for one speaker many qids were mentionned. We interpreted this multiple values as multiple wikipedia pages that may point to the same person but in different langagues. This could also come from the fact that there exists multiple wikipedia pages that points to different persons as homonyms may exist. So when many qids are mentionned we check that all the attributes are similar for all the qids, if not, then we are not able to determine which qid is the right one so unfortunately we discard the row."

    "The last preprocessing step consist in clustering the quotations as well as the speakers, this clustering will then be used to create a Recommandation Tool in the context of Brexit. The idea would be to first cluster the quotations and then the speakers such that two quotations/speakers that are in the same cluster are quotations/speakers carries on similar things/ideas. Performing such a task can be done following this pipeline:\n",
    "1. The first step is to convert sentences into vectors to be able to further perform the clustering. This task can be achieved using the [SentenceTransformer](https://www.sbert.net/docs/usage/semantic_textual_similarity.html) deep neural network. The vector obtained from this operation cab be then concatenated with the other existing features (that would be converted to one hot vectors if necessary).\n",
    "2. The second step consists in reducing the dimension of the datas before applying the clustering algorithm. This task can be achieved using the [T-stochastic neighbors embeddings](#https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html) algorithm or the [Locally Linear Embeddings](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.LocallyLinearEmbedding.html#sklearn.manifold.LocallyLinearEmbedding) algorithm. These two techniques (specially the first one) are efficient non-linear dimensionality reduction methods.\n",
    "3. The third step is specific to speaker clustering. Indeed the vectorization of quotes as well as the reduction of dimensionality is only applied to quotes. Thus we need to perform an **aggregation** to be able to attribute a vector to each speaker. For each speaker, this aggregation can simply be done by taking the mean of the vectors associated with each of their quotations. \n",
    "4. The last step consist in performing the clustering operation. This task can be achieved using [Gaussian Mixture Model](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html#mixture) algorithm or  [Spectral Clustering](#https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering.html#sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering) method."
