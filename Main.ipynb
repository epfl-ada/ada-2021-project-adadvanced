    "The last preprocessing step consist in clustering the quotations as well as the speakers, this clustering will then be used to create a Recommandation Tool in the context of Brexit. The idea would be to first cluster the quotations and then the speakers such that two quotations/speakers that are in the same cluster are quotations/speakers carries on similar things/ideas. Performing such a task can be done following this pipeline:\n",
    "1. The first step is to convert sentences into vectors to be able to further perform the clustering. This task can be achieved using the [SentenceTransformer](https://www.sbert.net/docs/usage/semantic_textual_similarity.html) deep neural network. The vector obtained from this operation cab be then concatenated with the other existing features (that would be converted to one hot vectors if necessary).\n",
    "2. The second step consists in reducing the dimension of the datas before applying the clustering algorithm. This task can be achieved using the [T-stochastic neighbors embeddings](#https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html) algorithm or the [Locally Linear Embeddings](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.LocallyLinearEmbedding.html#sklearn.manifold.LocallyLinearEmbedding) algorithm. These two techniques (specially the first one) are efficient non-linear dimensionality reduction methods.\n",
    "3. The third step is specific to speaker clustering. Indeed the vectorization of quotes as well as the reduction of dimensionality is only applied to quotes. Thus we need to perform an **aggregation** to be able to attribute a vector to each speaker. For each speaker, this aggregation can simply be done by taking the mean of the vectors associated with each of their quotations. \n",
    "4. The last step consist in performing the clustering operation. This task can be achieved using [Gaussian Mixture Model](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html#mixture) algorithm or  [Spectral Clustering](#https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering.html#sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering) method."
