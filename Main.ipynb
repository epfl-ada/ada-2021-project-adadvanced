    "- *[Data cleaning and merging](#augmentation)* : Perform a final cleaning on the quotations as well as on the speakers and generate 3 main datasets that will be used for the analysis\n",

Quotations and speakers that carry similar attributes/ideas will belong to the same cluster. Performing such task can be performed using the following pipeline:\n",
    "1. The first step is to convert sentences into vectors. This task can be achieved using the [SentenceTransformer](https://www.sbert.net/docs/usage/semantic_textual_similarity.html) deep neural network. The vector obtained from this operation cab be then concatenated with the other existing features (that would be converted to one hot vectors if necessary). The specific pre-trained neural network is [multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1), which attended the maximum score for better reliability.\n",
    "2. The second step consists in reducing the dimension of the data before applying the clustering algorithm. This task can be achieved using the [Locally Linear Embeddings](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.LocallyLinearEmbedding.html#sklearn.manifold.LocallyLinearEmbedding) algorithm. This algorithm is considered to be an efficient non-linear dimensionality reduction method.\n",
    "3. The third step is specific to speaker clustering. Indeed, the vectorization of quotes as well as the reduction of dimensionality are only applied to quotes. Thus, we need to perform an **aggregation** to be able to attribute a vector to each speaker. For each speaker, this aggregation can simply be done by taking the mean of the vectors associated with each of their quotations. \n",
    "4. The last step consists in performing the clustering operation. This task can be achieved using [Spectral Clustering](#https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering.html#sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering) method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Locally linear embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm aims at preserving the neighbouring points. The process is described as follows: \n",
    "- For each point, its nearest neighbors are determined. \n",
    "- Then it tries to project the new point in the embedded space such that its neighbors are preserved\n",
    "This spectral dimensionality reduction technique is non-linear, fast and reliable enough to handle big and complex dataset."

    "We would like to have more insights on how the Brexit influenced the Economy. To do so we will look at the top 100 british stock auctions also known at FTSE100 and try to see if they are correlated to the Brexit. To assess the correlation between Brexit and stock auction we followed the procedure described below: \n",
    "- We could actually measure the turmoil due to Brexit by looking at the evolution of the number of quotation accross time. A huge number of new quotations in a short time means that there is a a high turmoil due to Brexit. Thus it seems natural to estimate the Brexit turmoil through the derivative of the number quotations with respect to the time. Instead of taking the derivative of the original curve, we would rather take the derivative of the cumulative sum of the number of quotations with respect to time, as a decrease in the number of quotations would not have a real sense.\n",
    "- In the same spirit, regarding stock auctions, we are not really interested in the absolute value of them. We would rather prefer taking the derivative that tells you if the stock auction rises or falls. We then want to see if these rises or falls are correlated with Brexit turmoil. Besides, to simplify the things, we will take the absolute value of the derivative as Brexit may cause negative as well as positive effects.\n",
    "- Finally we will them compute the pearson coefficient correlation coefficient that will give us an insights on how Brexit is correlated with stock auction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before computing any derivative, it may be important to recall that we are performing some signal processing on the original time series (in a nutshell mooving average) to get ride of an eventual noise. At the end we will provide an interactive dashboard that will allow the user to see the correlation between Brexit and some stock auction. We will only keep the ones with a sufficient pearson correlation coefficient and sufficient low p-value. We will here again use a dynamic graph to generate such a dashboard, hence we will again follow the same procedure as decribed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so we need to use dynamic graphs, This can be achieved using dash plotly application. This application, as well as the associated stuff needed, will be embeded into a **Heroku** server that will actually host the application. We will need to create two things:\n",

    "- The script that will drive the application (callbacks, layout and so on ...)\n",
