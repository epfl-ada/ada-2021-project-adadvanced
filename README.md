# A Short Story of the Long Road to Brexit

## Abstract
In the last few years, Brexit has been one of the most trending topics in the world. Between 2015 and Britain's official EU exit in February 2020, countless discussions and debates have been generated around the subject. People coming from different backgrounds had a take on the matter, where views and opinions diversified and contrasted. Opponents speculated that the influence of Brexit would have negative impacts on certain sectors while supporters claimed the opposite. The aim of the study is to analyze the evolution of the perception of Brexit throughout the years (2015 - 2020). It would be interesting to look at this perception by aggregating the views by sector as well as by country, age, gender, ethnicity and educational level of the speakers. 

## Research Questions
The project aims at answering the following questions: 
<br/>
<br/>
Main Question:
<br/>
**How did the perception of Brexit evolve over time?** 
<br/>
<br/>
Supporting Questions:
<br/>
- Did the UK's view on Brexit switch much from 2016 until its exit in 2020? When did the turnarounds of perception happen?
- Which countries were the most supportive of the exit decision and which ones opposed it? What was the perception of European countries with regards to Brexit?
- Which sectors had the most negative take on Brexit? Which sectors had a significant change in perception (from negative to positive or vise versa) throughout the years?
- Is it true that older people were more in favor of Brexit than younger people?
- Did Brexit discussions influence the british stock market?

## Proposed additional datasets 
To enrich the quotebank data, we used additional information about the speakers that was provided by the `speaker_attributes.parquet` file. The source of the information is Wikidata. To complement the Quotebank data set, a sentiment analysis has been performed so to label the sentiment carried by the quote. Another dataset of interest is the FTSE100. This data set is accessible using the package [YFinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) and it gives the daily evolution of the stock actions throughout the years. 

## Methods
1. Data preprocessing: 
Before diving into the analysis of the data, it is crucial to have a look at the data itself and process it. A preprocessing task was performed on the data and it consisted of the following steps:
 - Data Exploration and Sanity Checks : Exploring the dataset, checking its consistency and getting familiar with the different features/information provided.
 - Data Extraction : Pulling out the quotes of interest that discuss Brexit.
 - Data Augmentation : Attributes related to the speaker & sentiment labelling of the quote (positive/neutral/negative):
     - Attributes of interest are extracted from Wikidata knowledge base using the speaker_attributes.parquet file
     - Mapping QIDs to meaningful labels
     - Sentiment labelling was performed using [NLTK's Vader Neural network](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/sentiment/vader.html) 
 - Final Cleaning of the data & Merging:
   - Eliminating very similar quotations using Sentence BERT 
       - Converting quotations into vectors using [SentenceTransformer](https://www.sbert.net/docs/usage/semantic_textual_similarity.html) deep neural network.
       - Computing [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) between each pair of quotations
       - Removing quotations that are too similar from the dataset
   - Removing quotations that do not have pertinent references (ambiguity regarding the speakers)
   - thresholding to remove categories with low number of occurences (categories: nationality, party, academic_degree, religion and gender)
   - manual grouping of different categories:
      - for the academic degree grouping into 5 categories: Professor, Phd, Master, Bachelor and 		  others
      - for religions grouping into 4 categories: Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Atheism
   - Aggregation of the data based on sectors, countries, gender and age categories
   - Identify time periods distributed on an almost uniform number of quotations
   - One hot-encoding of attributes
 - Quotations and speakers clustering :
   - Converting quotations into vectors using [SentenceTransformer](https://www.sbert.net/docs/usage/semantic_textual_similarity.html) deep neural network, encoding with the [multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1) algorithm.
   - Reducing the dimension of the data frame using [Locally Linear Embeddings](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.LocallyLinearEmbedding.html#sklearn.manifold.LocallyLinearEmbedding). This algorithm aims at preserving the neighbouring points. First, for each point, its nearest neighbors are determined. Then it tries to project the new point in the embedded space such that its neighbors are preserved
This spectral dimensionality reduction technique is non-linear, fast and reliable enough to handle big and complex dataset.
   - Perform aggregation to attribute a vector to each speaker.
   - Performing clustering using [Spectral Clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering.html#sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering) method.
   - Compare with the sentiment score.

2. Data Analysis:
- Generate Results: statistics and general description of the data
- Data visualisation:
    - evolution of the way Brexit is perceived in the UK 
    -
 + evolution of the way Brexit is perceived in European countries
 + evolution of the way Brexit is perceived in different sectors 
 + perception of Brexit by age 
 + perception of Brexit by gender 
 Pour tous les plots sauf celui des European countries, on évalue les différences entre chaque catégorie en comparant les moyennes associées à ces dernières par le biais d'un Welch t-test.  
 Concernant les plots intéractifs, ces derniers ont été déployés via la plateforme Heroku. 
 + influence of Brexit on the stock exchange
 To measure the correlation between the emergence of new events related to Brexit and movements in the stock exchange, the absolute value of the derivate was computed, in addition to the derivate of the number of quotations, both with respect to time. The derivatives are then used to compute the Pearson's correlation coefficient. For further information please check the stock market section in the Jupyter notebook.
 + clustering 

## Timeline
By the end of Milestone 2:
- The data has been properly explored, augmented and cleaned. 
- Additional data describing the attributes of the speakers have been processed (dealing with missing values), cleaned and one-hot encoded.
- Sentiment analysis has been performed. 
- Full merge of the dataset. 
- Clustering has been performed.
- Initial results/plots have been generated.

For Milestone 3:
- Finish tasks such that the correlation study with stock actions and enrich the existing ones
- Focus on proper visualizazion of the results in order to make conjectures that answer our research questions. 
- Deep and elaborate analysis of the results to write the final story. 
- Set up the platform.
- Propose recommendations for future work.
